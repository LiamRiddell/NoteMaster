## Introducing Smart Mode

NoteMaster Beta introduces the first key feature that makes NoteMaster unique. Smart Mode automatically recognizes keywords, and intelligently provides results as you type, for example:

Arithmetic

```
100 + 10 + 10 -> 120
```

Unit Conversion

```
100cm in m -> 0.1m
```

Currency Conversion

```
$100 in GBP -> £77.3
```

Percentages

```
10% of 100 -> 10
```

That's not all! Head over to [our documentation](https://www.google.com) for a list of all of the statements that NoteMaster can recognize.

## Additional Features

NoteMaster is continuously being developed. Our vision is to create the best open-source, note-taking app that boosts our users productivity. We've already added so much:

- Dark UI - We love the slickness of a dark UI, plus it's better for your eyes. Win-win!
- Smart Mode - Let NoteMaster do the heavy lifting with quick calculations and conversions.
- Persistent Notes - That's right! Your notes are saved as you type. RIP Save As.
- Magical Highlighting - Separate your notes with comments!
- Pin Window - Make NoteMaster fly high above other apps, so it's always visible above the focused window.
- Fullscreen - Dive deep and go fullscreen for a more in-depth note-making experience.
- Global Shortcut - Summon NoteMaster using `Windows + N`. Honestly, it's magic.
- Preferences - Make it your own by customising the font size, font weight, line height, line numbers...
- Export - You heard it! Export those lovely notes to another place on your device where you'll never open them again.
- Find/Replace - Become a `NoteMaster` (wow, that was bad) with the search functionality!
- Search with Google - Quickly highlight and search the selected text on Google.
- Emoji Support - Yes... amazing, and absolutely essential - we know. You can now have so much fire in your notes.
