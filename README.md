- Magical Highlighting - Separate the notes with them comments!
- Pin Window - Make NoteMaster fly high above other apps, so it's always visible.
- Fullscreen - Dive deep and go full screen for the ultimate note minimal note-making experience.
- Global Shortcut - Summon Notemaster using `Windows + N`. Honestly, it's magic.
- Preferences - It's a pick and mix of font size, font weight, line height, line numbers...
- Export - You heard it! Export them lovely notes to another place which you'll never open again.
- Find/Replace - You've become such as a `NoteMaster`(wow, that was bad) that you need to search!
- Search with Google - Quickly search your text selection on Google.
- Emoji Support - Yes... unreal, I know. You can now have so much fire in your notes.
